# Recipe App Demo - concrete5 portion
A simple learning package to create a recipe management application using Express. 
The concrete5 side of things is designed to really only handle the data portion, all
of the display will be handled with a separate application. 

What this package does:
* Install Recipe and Recipe Category Express Objects
* Create forms for both
* Provides routes for the javascript application to consume
